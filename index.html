					<h2>Electric cars are not the answer to air pollution, says top UK adviser</h2>
					<h3>Prof Frank Kelly says fewer not cleaner vehicles are needed, plus more cycling 
							and walking and better transit systems</h3>
				</hgroup>
					<p>Cars must be driven out of cities to tackle the UK’s air pollution crisis, not just 
						replaced with electric vehicles, according to the UK government’s top adviser.
					Prof Frank Kelly said that while electric vehicles emit no exhaust fumes, they still 
					produce large amounts of tiny pollution particles from brake and tyre dust, for which 
					the government already accepts there is no safe limit.</p>

					<h2>NHS to assess three hospitals to determine care for suicidal girl</h2>
					<h3>Officials to evaluate whether beds identified in three hospitals could provide 
							right care for girl believed to be at suicide risk</h3>
				</hgroup>
					<p>NHS officials are to spend the day assessing whether three hospitals can provide 
						proper care for a girl who is believed to be at serious risk of taking her own 
						life when she is released from youth custody in 10 days’ time, and for whom no 
						bed could be found.
					<br/><br/>
					Her urgent case was highlighted by the UK’s most senior family judge on Thursday. 
					Sir James Munby said the country would have “blood on its hands” were she released 
					with no proper plan in place for her ongoing care, and expressed his frustration at 
					not being able to safeguard her.
					<br/><br/>
					The girl, for legal reasons named only as X, has made a series of “determined attempts” 
					on her own life while in custody, and her carers had said they expected to hear she had 
					made another immediately after her release. With no secure bed available, she was due to 
					be released to the community in 10 days.</p>
